              Recognized as political nerve ends, the gatherers of information, the
              sifters of alternatives, the refiners of legislative detail, and the
              eyes and ears of the Parliament, much of the business of the House is
              handled by the Committees. The Senate of Pakistan has an efficient
              Committee System which has established traditions of sovereignty of
              the Parliament over the years and has dealt with a wide range of
              issues of national importance and public interest.
