          Senators are political representatives in the Senate, which is the upper house of the Legislature of Pakistan. They discuss proposed laws and vote on them like other representatives do, but Senators may have different powers than those in the National Assembly of Pakistan. The way they are chosen is also different:
          In Pakistan, elections to fill seats in the Senate allocated to each Province shall be held under the system of proportional representation through the single transferable vote. The Senate is not subject to dissolution but the term of its members is six years. Half of the Senate members retire after every three years and new ones are elected to replace them.
